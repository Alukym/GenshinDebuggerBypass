## Why? :sob::sob::skull::skull:

1. I don't like to private things.
2. You can do nothing if you know nothing about reverse engineering. If you are experience in reverse engineering, you should be able to create such tool on your own.
3. Just like what callow said:
    **You will release contributors' private code to public? Isn't it selfish?**![](https://i.imgur.com/LX2cL5e.png)



## Build
1. Download VS2022(select c++ development) and git.
2. Open VS2022 and clone the repo(sign in github if it asks to).
3. Build it.
